# Binning Exercise


## Problem Statement

You are testing inventory management software for a wholesaler. Each item in the inventory is assigned a bin number that identifies the location of the item in one of the two warehouses.

### Specification

1. The bin number is 6-8 characters in length.
2. The first three characters are DET or CHI representing either the Detroit or Chicago warehouse. The code DAL for the Dallas warehouse is no longer in use.
3. The fourth character is either a '-' or a '/'. The current system is the result of merging two legacy systems, one of which used '-' and the other of which used '/'
4. The fifth character is a letter from A to T representing the category of the product or product type.
